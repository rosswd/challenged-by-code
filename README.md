# Challenged by Code
For those times when you can't think what to build next. Particularly suitable
for beginners who are still trying to get out of tutorial loop. The idea behind
*Challenged by Code* is that, as a beginner, or someone further along that track:

- you find yourself not being able to do things others seem to do with ease, like
nested loops
- you cannot actually make anything although you can watch someone do it and/or
you can copy and paste their code

*Challenged by Code* is a list of resources that help you to try challenges. I
hope even if you fail you don't let it stop you - it is difficult being the new
guy/gal but it does get easier, if you are honest with yourself.

`daily.md` contains most of the challenges. `search.md` lists places to search
for code.
